## Design Goals / Approach

I have tried to keep the design simple and minimalistic but at the same time used some css animations and effects to make the website more interesting to the user.

## Features

The website enables the user to send me messages directly through the contact page.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this portfolio:

1. React E-Shop: An e-commerce full stack website developed in React.JS, SCSS, with Firestore realtime integration.
2. Google Books: A platform that enables the users to search for books and get more details about a certain title. I used React.JS and SCSS for front-end and utilized google books API as the backend.
3. This is a simulation of Windows XP user interface showcasing my Javascript, SCSS and HTML abilities.
4. A single page application in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing user to input and translate English text to Morse code and vice versa.
5. A Minesweeper game in Java which allows the user to customize the number of mines and also the grid dimensions. In this Java game I have utilized AWT to create a graphical user interface.

## Future Goals

- Working on the presentation of the "about" section on mobile devices to achieve a more attractive appearance.
